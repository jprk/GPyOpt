## GPyOpt as a tool for science dissemination

We are very proud of using GPyOpt not only for research but also to create a community of people interested in Bayesian optimization and related techniques. We use GPyOpt in [summer schools](http://gpss.cc/) to facilitating the understanding of Bayesian optimization. 


*Gaussian process summer school (organized by [Neil Lawrence](http://inverseprobability.com/), [Javier Gonzalez](http://javiergonzalezh.github.io/) and the [SheffieldML group](http://sheffieldml.github.io/) in Sheffield in September 2015). GPy and GPyOpt was used for the hands-on labs!*

*Course in Bayesian Optimization based on GPyOpt delivered on October 27-30th, 2015 at the University of Pereira Colombia (organized by [Javier Gonzalez](http://javiergonzalezh.github.io/) and  [Mauricio Alvarez](https://sites.google.com/site/maalvarezl)).*
